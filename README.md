# Adult-census-income
classification on  [adult-census-income dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income) with some minor changes.<br>
Models have been made via different classifiers like RandomForest, SVC, Decision Tree, LogisticRegression, naive bayes(Bernoulli and gaussian)
and some others.<br>
## Notebook description
These notebooks include EDA, handling missing data, feature engineering and feature extraction methods like PCA, RFE, RFECV and
feature_importances.<br>
Note that the modified dataset has been uploaded in this repository.<br>
Because of dataset imbalanced classes, I had to solve this problem with methods like 
over/under sampling, SMOTE, Borderline SMOTE and Penalize Algorithms (Cost-Sensitive Training).<br>
My highest accuracy: 86% <br>
My hghest f1-score: 68%
